  ### Results
  ---

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- **Sales & Profit Trends**: The analysis revealed a steady increase in both sales and profit over the years, with notable spikes during certain periods.
 
- **Top Performing Countries**: The top-performing countries in terms of revenue were the France, Canada, and United State, contributing the highest units sold and profits.

- **Product Insights**: Products in the "Premium" category showed the best performance, particularly those with medium to high discount bands. This suggests that offering discounts may lead to better sales performance.

- **Impact of Discount Bands**: A significant relationship was observed between discount levels and sales, with higher discounts often leading to increased sales volume but reduced profit margins.
 
- **Key Insights**: The country-wise insights revealed that certain regions have higher sales potential, indicating that regional marketing strategies could drive growth in underperforming countries.

### Recommendations
---

- **Focus on High-Performing Countries**: Increase marketing efforts and resources in top-performing countries like the Canada and France to maximize sales and profits.

- **Optimize Discount Strategies**: While higher discounts increase sales volume, they can reduce profit margins. Implement tiered discount strategies to balance sales growth and profitability.

- **Invest in Premium Products**: Premium products with medium to high discounts show strong performance. Consider expanding the product line and promoting these categories more aggressively.

- **Explore Regional Opportunities**: Identify underperforming regions and develop localized marketing campaigns to drive sales in those areas.

- **Analyze Seasonal Trends**: Further analysis of seasonal sales trends can help optimize inventory and align promotional campaigns with peak sales periods.

- **Monitor Profit Margins**: Regularly track profit margins by segment and product category to identify opportunities for cost optimization.

###  Limitations
---

- Missing values were filled with default values, which may not reflect actual data and could affect accuracy. 
- Formatting assumed consistency in currency and date, which might not align with the dataset's original context. 
- External factors like economic conditions or market trends were not considered. 
- Combining date columns removed some granular details that could be useful for deeper analysis.
