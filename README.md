### Project Overview


This project is an interactive financial sales dashboard built in Excel. It provides key insights into sales performance across different segments, countries, and products using charts, slicers, and pivot tables for dynamic filtering and analysis.

### Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's financial dataset collection. The source provides raw data on sales, profits, and other financial metrics that have been cleaned and visualized in this project.

### Tools used

- Excel Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, and Formatting

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

1.  Standardized text formatting (e.g., country names).
2.  Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
3.   Converted monetary columns (sales, discounts, profit) into a currency format.
4.    Combined separate date columns into a single readable date format.

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Sales & Profit Analysis**: Analyzed total sales and profit across years.
- **Country-wise Insights**: Compared units sold and revenue by country.
- **Product Performance**: Assessed sales and discount band effectiveness.
- **Interactive Filters**: Added filters for segment, year, product, and discount levels.

  ### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- **Sales & Profit Trends**: The analysis revealed a steady increase in both sales and profit over the years, with notable spikes during certain periods.
 
- **Top Performing Countries**: The top-performing countries in terms of revenue were the France, Canada, and United State, contributing the highest units sold and profits.

- **Product Insights**: Products in the "Premium" category showed the best performance, particularly those with medium to high discount bands. This suggests that offering discounts may lead to better sales performance.

- **Impact of Discount Bands**: A significant relationship was observed between discount levels and sales, with higher discounts often leading to increased sales volume but reduced profit margins.
 
- **Key Insights**: The country-wise insights revealed that certain regions have higher sales potential, indicating that regional marketing strategies could drive growth in underperforming countries.

### Recommendations

- **Focus on High-Performing Countries**: Increase marketing efforts and resources in top-performing countries like the Canada and France to maximize sales and profits.

- **Optimize Discount Strategies**: While higher discounts increase sales volume, they can reduce profit margins. Implement tiered discount strategies to balance sales growth and profitability.

- **Invest in Premium Products**: Premium products with medium to high discounts show strong performance. Consider expanding the product line and promoting these categories more aggressively.

- **Explore Regional Opportunities**: Identify underperforming regions and develop localized marketing campaigns to drive sales in those areas.

- **Analyze Seasonal Trends**: Further analysis of seasonal sales trends can help optimize inventory and align promotional campaigns with peak sales periods.

- **Monitor Profit Margins**: Regularly track profit margins by segment and product category to identify opportunities for cost optimization.

###  Limitations

- Missing values were filled with default values, which may not reflect actual data and could affect accuracy. 
- Formatting assumed consistency in currency and date, which might not align with the dataset's original context. 
- External factors like economic conditions or market trends were not considered. 
- Combining date columns removed some granular details that could be useful for deeper analysis.
